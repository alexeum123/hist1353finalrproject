                The enslavement of Africans and their forced conversion to Roman Catholicism during the period of
                European colonial expansion was compounded by their brutal conditions, including harsh labor,
                punishment, and the removal/forced abandonment of their identity and heritage. Their forced conversion
                to Roman Catholicism,
                was a common policy utilized by European colonizers, particularly the Spanish and Portuguese. The
                Europeans believed they were saving their souls by introducing Christianity,
                but simultaneously, the conversion was seen as a tool for social control, as it was thought to pacify
                and
                integrate enslaved populations into colonial societies. The process of conversion often began
                immediately upon the captives' arrival. Baptism was a key component, symbolizing a break from their past
                and the adoption of new, Christian identities (and their new economic circumstances). However, these
                conversions were superficial in many cases, but despite the forced conversions, many enslaved Africans
                retained elements of their traditional beliefs and practices. Over time, this led to the development of
                syncretic religions, combining elements of African spiritual practices with Roman Catholicism. Examples
                include Vodun in Haiti, Candomblé in Brazil, and Santería in Cuba.

                The Catholic Iberian presence in the Western Hemisphere, marked predominantly by Spain and Portugal,
                played a pivotal role in shaping the course of global history. The Reconquista, the centuries-long
                campaign to expel Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula, culminated in 1492, leaving these nations with a
                heightened sense of religious mission and a newfound focus on overseas expansion. The Spanish monarchs,
                Queen Isabella of Castile and King Ferdinand of Aragon, were instrumental in this expansion. Their
                campaign, resulting in the unification of Spain under Christian rule, was marked by a concerted effort
                to spread Catholicism. The expulsion of Jews and Muslims unless they converted to Christianity was a
                testament to the era's religious intolerance, and their sponsorship of Christopher Columbus's 1492
                voyage was motivated partly by the
                desire to spread Christianity and partly by the search for new trade routes, especially to Asia. This
                voyage led to the unexpected discovery of the New World, opening an era of exploration and
                colonization. Portugal, under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator and later King John II,
                focused on exploring the African coast and finding a sea route to India. These expeditions were also
                deeply intertwined with the Catholic faith, as they sought to counter the Muslim dominance of Eastern
                trade routes and to find potential Christian allies against Islam.

                The colonial ambitions of European nations were significantly driven by religious objectives. Catholic
                doctrine, emphasizing the salvation of souls, became a key motivator in the expansionist policies of
                these empires. This religious drive was not a simple quest for new lands or wealth; it was often
                portrayed as a divine mandate, a mission sanctioned by God. Stemming from Dum Diversas (1452) and
                Romanus Pontifex (1455), the Doctrine of Discovery granted Christian rulers the authority to claim
                territories they discovered and to propagate Christian teachings there. It became the cornerstone of
                European colonialism, intertwining religious mission with territorial expansion.

                Christopher Columbus, often revered as the "Admiral of the Ocean Sea," remains one of the most iconic
                figures in the Age of Exploration. His voyages across the Atlantic, under the patronage of Spain's
                Catholic Monarchs, were pivotal in connecting the continents of Europe and the Americas. His primary
                goal was to establish a new trade route to the riches of the East Indies, bypassing the overland routes
                dominated by Muslim powers. Columbus, who was deeply religious himself, also embraced the idea of
                spreading Christianity to the lands he intended to explore. Spain's Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella of
                Castile and King Ferdinand of Aragon, saw potential in Columbus's plan. In 1492, following the
                completion of the Reconquista, they agreed to sponsor his voyage. This decision was influenced by the
                desire to expand Spanish influence, to gain a competitive edge in global trade, and spread Catholicism.
                Columbus undertook four voyages across the Atlantic between 1492 and 1504, which had profound religious
                implications. They were not only exploratory missions but also resembled the crusades, bearing the cross
                alongside the flag. The spread of Catholicism was a significant aspect of Spanish colonization that
                followed. Columbus himself set the precedent by initiating the conversion of indigenous peoples to
                Christianity.

                Many conquistadors saw their expeditions as extensions of the crusades. Figures like Hernán Cortés and
                Francisco Pizarro often described their conquests in religious terms, blending their thirst for gold and
                glory with a proclaimed desire to spread Christianity. This crusading spirit was a critical aspect of
                their self-justification, intertwining religious zeal with imperial ambition.

                The Catholic Church played a crucial role in the expansion of Iberian empires. The Treaty of Tordesillas
                in 1494, mediated by Pope Alexander VI, divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between
                Portugal and Spain. This treaty was crucial in legitimizing and facilitating Iberian expansion in the
                name of spreading Catholicism. This division, sanctioned by the Church, underlines how religion was used
                not only to legitimize colonial claims but also to maintain peace between the two Catholic superpowers.
                The Spanish and Portuguese colonization of the Americas was not just a pursuit of wealth and land; it
                was also a religious crusade. Missionaries, mainly Jesuits, Franciscans, and Dominicans, accompanied
                conquistadors to convert indigenous populations to Christianity. This religious mission was often used
                to justify the harsh treatment and subjugation of native peoples.

                The "Suma de Tratos y Contratos," in the context of Spain's burgeoning overseas commerce, reflects the
                Catholic Church's influence on economic practices during the colonial period. This work, written by
                Tomás de Mercado, was a pivotal text reconciling commercial activities with Catholic doctrine, which
                viewed usury, or lending money at interest, as a sin. Mercado's work provided guidelines for ethical
                trade and financial dealings, aligning them with Christian morals. This alignment was crucial in an era
                where Spain's global economic activities were expanding rapidly, requiring a fine balance between
                economic growth and adherence to religious principles.

                In Havana and the general Caribbean, Spanish colonization was marked by the establishment of Catholic
                missions. These missions served two purposes: as centers for religious conversion and as instruments of
                Spanish control. They played a pivotal role in integrating the indigenous populations into the colonial
                system, often at the cost of eradicating native cultures and religious practices.
